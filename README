# `extract-txt`
This program will generate the text of a PDF file, scraped of special
characters. This will make it easy for a TeX-built resume to be displayed in
plaintext, without any special characters. This assumes that a program like
`latexmk` has already generated a file like `resume.dvi`.

In essence, this program does
```
.dvi ---> .txt
```

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/thevedantmodi/extract-text-resume
cd extract-text-resume
./install.sh
extract-txt resume.dvi
```
